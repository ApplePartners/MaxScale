 *    "  SELECT                   => "SELECT"

 *
 *  @param sql  Pointer to buffer containing a MySQL statement
 *  @param len  Length of sql.
 *
 *  @return The first non whitespace (including comments) character. If the
 *          entire buffer is only whitespace, the returned pointer will point
 *          to the character following the buffer (i.e. sql + len).
