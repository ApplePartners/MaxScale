/**
 * NOTE: Do not include this header in any file other than `misc.cc`.
 *
 * The commit hash and other values that will be different for each build are stored here instead of in the
 * public MaxScale headers to prevent them from being included in the preprocessed source code. If the literal
 * values are included, compiler caches like `ccache` and `distcc` that rely on preprocessed sources are
 * unable to reuse the objects since each of them will be unique due to the commit has being included as a
 * string literal.
 *
 * The MaxScale version number is, however, a compile time constant (in version.hh.in) and it is desirable to
 * keep it so to make sure that the modules get compiled with the actual version number as a constant. If it
 * was an external symbol, the check for cross-version usage would be meaningless as the MaxScale core would
 * provide the symbol and it would always be what is expected.
