# Session Resource

A session is an abstraction of a client connection, any number of related backend
connections, a router module session and possibly filter module sessions. Each
session is created on a service and each service can have multiple sessions.

## Resource Operations

### Get a session

```
GET /v1/sessions/:id
```

Get a single session. _:id_ must be a valid session ID. The session ID is the
same that is exposed to the client as the connection ID.

This endpoint also supports the `rdns=true` parameter, which instructs MaxScale to
perform reverse DNS on the client IP address. As this requires communicating with
an external server, the operation may be expensive.

#### Response

`Status: 200 OK`
