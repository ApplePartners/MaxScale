/**
 * MXS-2037: Wildcards not working with source in NamedServerFilter
 *
 * https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-2037
 *
 * This test only tests that ip addresses with wildcards are accepted by
 * NamedServerFilter. The actual matching functionality is not tested
 * because the client IPs can change with the different test environments
 * and that would make it complicated to check if the matching is correct.
